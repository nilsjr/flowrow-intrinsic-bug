## Description

tbd.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Clone the repository

2. Open the project in Android Studio

3. Open de.nilsdruyen.flowrow.intrinsic.FlowRowBug.kt and show preview

## Expected behavior

I would assume that the androidx.compose.foundation.layout.FlowRow is calculating the needed height
correctly and resizes the parent layout so every information its visible
